# Image Inpainting for Old Photographs using Cascaded Modulation GAN

## Overview
This project aims to restore old and damaged photographs by inpainting missing or damaged parts using a cascaded modulation Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) approach. 

## Description
The project utilizes advanced deep learning techniques to inpaint missing or damaged regions in old photographs. The cascaded modulation GAN architecture is employed to generate high-quality inpaintings by iteratively refining the results. 

## Features
- Inpainting missing or damaged regions in old photographs
- Utilization of cascaded modulation GAN for improved inpainting quality
- Iterative refinement process for generating high-fidelity inpaintings
- Customizable parameters for fine-tuning the inpainting process
- Compatible with various image formats

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Other dependencies as specified in requirements.txt

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

## Acknowledgements
We would like to thank my advisor and all the contributors who helped me in completing this research work. The proposed Cascaded Modulation GAN (CM-GAN) presents a significant advancement in the field of image inpainting. The contributions of CM-GAN extend beyond its architectural design, encompassing an object-aware mask  generation scheme, a masked R1 regularization for improved stability, and comprehensive training losses that enhance the model's inpainting capabilities.
